Web Bank App
Overview
The Web Bank App is a full-stack software system that simulates basic banking operations.
This is an educational project that was born out of curiosity and a desire to explore modern technologies and architectural designs used in contemporary web apps.
For this project, I independently learned and implemented the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack through self-directed study and hands-on practice.
