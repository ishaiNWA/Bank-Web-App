**Web Bank App**

**Overview**
The Web Bank App is a full-stack software system that simulates basic banking operations.
This  is an educational project that was born out of curiosity and a desire to explore modern technologies and architectural designs used in contemporary web apps.
For this project, I independently learned and implemented the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack through self-directed study and hands-on practice.

**Tech Stack**
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

**Key Features**


1) User Authentication
-Secure login and registration system
-Email confirmation for new accounts

2) User Authorization
- JWT based authorization for protected private resource access
 
3)Account Operations
- View current balance
- Perform money transactions
- Access paginated transaction history

4)Security Measures
- Password hashing with salt for enhanced security
- Atomic database operations to ensure data integrity


**Technical Highlights**

1)RESTful API Design 
-Well-structured endpoints for various banking operations

2)Express.js Routing
-Organized route handling for logically different functionalities
-Middleware implementation for authentication and error handling


3)Database Efficiency
- Optimized MongoDB queries
- Efficient database indexing for quick retrieval of transaction history

4)Security Implementation
-Secure password storage using industry standard hashing algorithms


**Future Enhancements**

  1)Publishing REST API documentation using Swagger
  
  2)Adding admin role and functionalities
